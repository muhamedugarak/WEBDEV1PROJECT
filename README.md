# WEBDEV1PROJECT
This is a mock page for a auto repair shop. It is to display what I have learned through the Code Louisville Web Development 1 Course.

The three requirements I have chosen to incorporate were:


a responive menu that switched between desktop and mobile, 
pagespeeeds insight,
and a basic "hover over me" button at the very top of the page.

I got the hang of web development very late in the course. Things I seemed to struggle with greatly, started making sense at the end. I'll be practicing much more in my free time now that this does not feel so intimidating anymore.
